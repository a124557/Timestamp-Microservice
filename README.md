## Timestamp Microservice

A full stack microservice developed with JavaScript and Node.js. Takes a URL ending in a date with a standard format (e.g. 2015-10-12) or in milliseconds 
(e.g 1451001600000), and returns the date and time in a unix and utc key within a json object.

Developed with Replit.
